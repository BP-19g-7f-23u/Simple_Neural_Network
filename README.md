## Overview
The goal of this project was to create a neural network capable of accurately classifying images into one of the ten categories provided in the Fashion MNIST dataset. The project involved the following steps:

_Loading and inspecting the dataset.
_Normalizing the image data.
_Defining the neural network model.
_Training the model with validation and early stopping.
_Evaluating the model's performance.
_Visualizing training progress and results.
